// object oriented programming is imperative
// programming
// functional programming is declarative 
// programming
// javasript combines both imperative and 
// declarative
// javascript is a multi paradigm language
// it is an interpreted language not compiled
// it goes line by line
// it is a high level language
// it is a scripting language
// it is single threaded language
// this means it runs one process at a time
// not parallel
// it is extremely flexible like working in
// the browser

// to print say console.log
console.log('Party')
// three types of variables
// var, let and const
// var and let are similar and cons is different
// const protects you from re assigning variables unlike var and let
// type error is a datatype error
// two datatypes - primitive and object
// primitive are boolean, number, strings, undefined, null
// undefine is when we want to unintentionally declare a variable
// null is intenrionally
// for example if you write let name; - javascript will say undefined unless you say let name = 'taroj'
// undefined and null are actual values in javascript
// nan is not a number but it is a number
// nothing can't live in hollow space
// a number that javascript does not understand is nan
// we cannot change values of primitive datatypes
// every other datatypes in javasript are objects - arrays, objects, functions, regex, data
// to know what a particular datatype is used typeof - console.log(typeof 3) will show number in the console
// we can reassign - let m = 4, then m = '4'
// = is assignment, == is abstract equality, === is strict equality
// always use === over double because for example 13 == '13' will be the same 
// === for conditionals
// methods - let n = 123.456
// let s1 = n.toString()
// console.log(typeof s1)
// string
// everything is an object and is borrowing from a parent object and making a prototype
// control flow
// everything is true except 0, null, undefined, false, nan
